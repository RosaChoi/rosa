                        <h6>My Root in Asia</h6>
                        <img src="../../assets/images/pages/blog/rosa.jpg">
                        <p>
                            I was born on August 7th to a humble Catholic family in Seoul, S. Korea. Soon after my birth, we moved to Osaka, Japan until at the age of 4, my family returned to Seoul where we lived until I was 13. Thanks to my mom, I did very well in school. She noticed my talent for art, pushing me to excel as I won numerous awards in academic competitions and local art fairs. My life was ordinary, yet fulfilling until we immigrated in late summer, 1990, to America, the land of opportunity.
                        </p>

                        <h6>American Dream?</h6>
                        <img src="../../assets/images/pages/blog/americandream.jpg">
                        <p>
                            My life was turned upside down. I was enrolled in the Einstein Middle School as a 7th grader in Seattle, WA. All of sudden, I wasn’t in my comfort zone and I didn’t speak a word of English.  I was painfully homesick.<br/>
                            <br/>After three months of constant rain and tears, we left Seattle and found a new home in a beautiful city by the Bay in the Golden State. Instantly, I fell in love with San Francisco and found that I was no longer a stranger. San Francisco felt like home.  Occupying all corners of this picture perfect city were are all sizes, shapes and colors - everything beautiful and ugly; all accepted.<br/>
                            <br/>My high school years were equal parts rough and rebelliously fun times!  Yet, I was still serious enough to enter and win a 2nd prize in the Bay Area Youth Architecture Competition my senior year. This win encouraged my dream to study and pursue art!
                        </p>

                        <h6>I heart ART</h6>
                        <img src="../../assets/images/pages/blog/art.jpg">
                        <p>
                            In 2001, I graduated from Academy of Art University with two Bachelor's degrees; one in Illustration/Fine Art and the other in Computer Arts. Despite the commitment I had made to devote my life to art and design, I wasn't ready to pursue it full time and couldn't make ends meet to repay my student loans!
                        </p>

                        <h6>Entry to the Tech World</h6>
                        <img src="../../assets/images/pages/blog/samsung.jpg">
                        <p>
                            I changed my strategy; landing a job at Samsung Semiconductor Inc. in Silicon Valley as an Executive Assistant to the CEO and President. It was an amazing opportunity for me to work at a world-class corporation and gave me the priceless chance to witness the birth of cutting-edge innovative products. Every day was filled with high volume, fast paced work tasks; leaving little room for life outside.  Although I thoroughly enjoyed the ferocious work environment and the rush of being around high profile technology leaders and the perks that come with this type of position, after 4 and a half years I was ready to travel the world beyond Silicon Valley.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Bon Voyage</h6>
                        <img src="../../assets/images/pages/blog/paris-story.jpg">
                        <p>
                            What better way to celebrate the big 3-0 and exiting the high stress world of Corporate Silicon Valley than to jump out of an airplane at 13,000 feet?! I deserved this exciting free fall, a metaphor for the new phase in my life. I convinced my best friend, broken arm and all, to skydive with me. We were at once terrified and excited as the plane took off from the runway - there was no going back, on this free fall or with my life plan.<br/>
                            <br/>Then I was given a perfect reason to travel. I was invited to a friend’s wedding in France. After attending a traditional French wedding in Saint-Étienne, I traveled to Avignon and Orange, and then took TGV to Lyon and Paris. As a student of art, I couldn’t help but fall in love with Paris. I spent many days walking; taking in as much of the history and magnificent architecture, art, music, and culinary experiences I could to gain a glimpse into the life of Parisians. My 15 days flew by in a blink and I was off to Barcelona.<br/>
                            <br/>Unlike Parisians, people in Barcelona loved to chat, didn’t mind speaking in broken English and appeared very laid back. They were warm, friendly, flirty, and as passionate as their Mediterranean weather is to travelers. I delved right into Antoni Gaudi’s exquisite architecture and works, spending hours admiring them. Dining at Els 4 Gats where artists, including Picasso and Salvador Dali gathered in their time to chat was unforgettable. Every waking moment was a blessing and filled with dazzling experiences. When the sun went down, I enjoyed different kinds of paella and watching flamenco dancers perform. Leaving Barcelona, I promised myself that I would one day revisit this exhilarating city.
                        </p>

                         <h6>Charting A New Territory</h6>
                        <img src="../../assets/images/pages/blog/ad.jpg">
                        <p>
                            While working at Samsung, I started reading about macroeconomics and found stock trading quite stimulating. I began day trading and option trading. There was so much to learn and digest; from new jargon to reading charts, knowing which trend to follow to which companies are considered bellwethers. Dedicated, I woke up every morning at 5am to watch CNBC. With the opening bell of the stock market, my body would flow with an adrenaline rush that lasted through the ding-ding of the closing bell. The highs and lows that I experienced during this time were very addictive and I soon became a stock junky. However, I wasn’t knowledgeable enough, nor my bankroll large enough to sustain my trial and come through successfully.<br/>
                            <br/>It was difficult to accept my failure and move on. When the US financial market was in turmoil, I was incredibly fortunate to be offered a job in Abu Dhabi, a place I had never heard of. Through my stock trading, I was aware of Dubai, Qatar and Saudi and that these places were still growing with their petro dollars but I never thought that I would be working and living in Abu Dhabi, in the Middle East!  Despite all the worries and concerns expressed by family and friends, I packed my luggage and embarked on a 17-hour direct flight from SFO to Dubai.<br/>
                            <br/> Admittedly, it wasn’t easy to get acclimated to my new surroundings. This new world was entirely foreign to me from the moment I stepped off the plane. It was difficult to understand the multiple layers, different social classes, and the complexity of this not yet 40 year-old country. This is where modern luxury on steroids had a shotgun marriage with the traditions of Bedouin. I was intrigued to learn and understand the real thing that makes Emirati and this nation so special, but was unable to go beyond their White Kandoras and Black Abayas until I met an extraordinary man in late 2010. 
                        </p>
                        <img src="../../assets/images/pages/blog/wasel.jpg">
                        <p>
                            His name was Wasel Safwan, a well-known local artist who had a beautiful studio out in the desert. An Art Professor that I worked with at NYU Abu Dhabi invited Wasel to a Visual Art Conversation group that I was facilitating. After that chance meeting, we met a couple more times through NYU Abu Dhabi’s events and social gatherings. Then he invited me to his studio in Al Ain. The contrast between his abstract contemporary paintings against the undulating sand dunes was striking.<br/>
                            <br/>My admiration toward his artwork soon turned into a romance and our courtship continued. Through Wasel, I discovered the whole spectrum of life in UAE. I had a better understanding of how different social groups interacted. I developed a deeper understanding of the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) as a whole and became more aware of subtleties and details. We traveled together locally to the Empty Quarter and to the border of Saudi Arabia. Wasel took me to places in UAE that I would have never reached without a local guide. 
                        </p>
                        <img src="../../assets/images/pages/blog/germany.jpg">
                        <p>
                            In December, 2011, Wasel had a month-long project with the German Embassy and headed to Dresden. I felt this was once again a perfect excuse to travel! We travelled through the German countryside by train. For Wasel, this was his first time to see snow, and even for me, it had been a such a long time that we were like two happy puppies running all over the place with the utmost of excitement. The Christmas market in Nürnberg was incredibly festive and we felt like we were in wonderland. While in Munich, he popped a question, “Why don’t we get married?” Through our travels, we had learned more about each other and were at once inseparable. <br/>
                            <br/>Next, Wasel and I stumbled upon an astonishing opportunity to work as a team. CapitaLand, Singaporean Real Estate giant had a project in Abu Dhabi and was looking for an artist to do commission work. Wasel created 5 large-scale oil paintings for each of the 5 brand-new high-rise towers. The client wanted each painting to be the centerpiece of the lobby. While Wasel was working on these paintings, I worked as a project manager and artist manager to oversee project parameters, work schedule, contract management, track expense, host visitors, and coordinate the opening reception. Our partnership seemed natural and we both knew instantly that we thrive together in a creative environment. We completed our project in sixty-six days and this marked our first project together.<br/>
                            <br/>Despite my affection towards the people I worked with at NYU Abu Dhabi and newfound attachment to this land, it was time for Wasel and I to leave Abu Dhabi and embark on another venture to Little Red Dot.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Happily Living in Asia</h6>
                        <img src="../../assets/images/pages/blog/reddot.jpg">
                        <p>
                            I had no idea Singapore was called the Little Red Dot until I got there. Singapore is quite small even for an Island, but its ambition is truly world class. I was blown away by Singapore’s immaculate infrastructure and development without any natural resources. Their hard working ethics and strength in education transformed the unthinkable into a neat and systematic reality. <br/>
                            <br/>Wasel has always been fascinated by Asian culture and was genuinely happy in Singapore; even picking up some Singlish. I on the other hand, had a difficult time adjusting to the tropical climate and was sick quite frequently with “I miss San Francisco” becoming my daily slogan.<br/>
                            <br/>Despite my dislike towards the extreme humidity, Singapore will always have a special place in our hearts. This is where Wasel and I registered our marriage in the beautiful House at Dempsey. In honor of his wife, Wasel adopted my last name and became Wasel Choi and we had a mini honeymoon in Ubin Island, completed Wasel’s immigration to the US, and I worked at NYU Tisch School of Arts in Asia in the Film department. We also traveled extensively to Malaysia and covered most of the places including Kota Kinabalu in Borneo Island.<br/>
                            <br/>Ironically, as I once emigrated from Incheon Airport in Korea to US at age 13, Wasel and I once again crossed the Pacific Ocean to reach San Francisco from Incheon Airport. Perhaps some things in life are truly meant to be.

                         <h6>Homecoming</h6>
                        <img src="../../assets/images/pages/blog/homecoming.jpg">
                        <p>
                            Alas, I am back home after 4 years of living abroad. This time I brought a man with me. <br/>
                            <br/>Currently, I’m enjoying life with my husband, who loves San Francisco equally as much as I. I’m thirsty and hungry to learn, create, and contribute; with my best work and greatest adventures still ahead. I am tremendously fortunate to be surrounded by open source communities and incredibly talented individuals and entrepreneurs in San Francisco. As Technology continues to evolve and become even more deeply integrated into our daily lives, smart design will become a requirement rather than a nice-to-have feature, driven by Tech-savvy consumers. I am excited to be back and ready to do some wicked design! So thank you for visiting my site and reading my story.
