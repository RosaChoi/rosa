            <article class="smallFontBy08">
                <p>
                    The Time Locket is a compelling story about a girl who flees modern day NYC to her grandmother's house in NC, but also found herself time travlled to The Lost Colony in Roanoke Island. This colony was named after the historical Roanoke Carolina Algonquian people who inhabited the region in the 16th century at the time of English exploration. Deborah's story is filled with plot twists, history, humor and romance.<b/>
                    <b/>The goal was to create a scaleable cover illustration/design for both e-book and print-on-demand formats. The author wanted a contemporary vibe, and graphic image that gives a nice visual punch, thereby capturing the curiosity and imagination of the Young Adult reading audience.

                <p>“Working with Rosa on the cover of The Time Locket was a fantastic experience, which isn't usually what people say about working with designers. She never dismissed my suggestions, even when it became clear that her original designs were the right way to go. I had no problems uploading her files to the various sites I was using for e-publishing and print-on-demand; she turned in beautiful work in a professional and timely manner. Rosa will be the designer I turn to for all my future projects, and in fact I've already recommended her to several other writers.”
