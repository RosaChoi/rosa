                    Prof. Reindert Falkenburg, Vice Provost at NYU Abu Dhabi, has been and remains a dear friend, and a special mentor to designer Rosa. For his new book, a ten-year labor of love, Prof. Falkenburg needed a cover illustration and he approached Rosa for the design. When asked if she was interested in creating this cover design, she didn't hesitate to say yes!<br/> 
                    <br>Her mission was to create an illustration that captures the essence of the author’s interpretation of Hieronymus Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights. The author wanted an image to depict the Gestalt of the Mouth of Hell. He offers the interpretation that Bosch’s triptych should, or could, be read as a speculum of the infernal course mankind has taken in a world that is perverted by satanic forces. Our challenge was to create an image by using Bosch’s own triptych painting to illustrate the author’s interpretation.

                <h5 class="testimonial">A Few Words from Reindert Falkenburg</h5>
                <p>“The result of Rosa's inventive recombination of motifs from Bosch' own painting beautifully summarizes the essence of his work: that the image of the world as one huge pleasure garden is a dream of man's own libidinous imagination - in and around which the monstrous handyman of the devil are eager to take human souls to dance. Rosa's design articulates better than words the content of my study of Bosch's painting - what more can an author wish from a truly artistic designer.”
